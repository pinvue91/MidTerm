Grand Circus Detroit C# .NET Bootcamp Midterm project that involves the collaboration of 3 students to create a point of sale terminal for a Record Store. 
Implements use of classes, polymorphism, user input, validations, arrays, collections, file I/O, and exception handling. 
POS terminal prompts user to look at current inventory, to buy an album, or to sell an album to the store (which is then added to the inventory).
POS terminal also allows user to add multiple items to the shopping cart, calculates total + sales tax, accepts different payment types, and prints out a receipt for the user.
